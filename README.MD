# Description Logic Engine

## What this is

This is a description logic engine based on the **ALCQ language (ALC extended with number qualified restrictions)**. It is an implementation of the **Tableau** algorithm: provided an **ABOX** (assertions) and a **TBOX** (terminology definitions), the algorithm will determine satisfiability. It also can handle **Subsumption** questions (**"Is the PREMISE subsumed by the ABOX & TBOX?"**).
